            <br><b>A B O U T</b><br><br>
            Sigma Psi Zeta is a multicultural, Asian-interest (but not
            Asian-exclusive!) sorority. We value unity, strength,
            professionalism and sisterhood. Our National Philanthropy is to
            Combat the Violence Against Women in its varied forms. Including,
            but not limited to, domestic violence and sex trafficking. We are an
            official partner of the White House initiative, It's On Us, a
            campaign to end sexual assault on college campuses. We do not
            believe there is a typical Sigma; Sisterhood is not a mold for women
            to fit into. In fact, our differences are what enhance and enrich
            our experiences as sisters. If you are looking for a group of
            lifelong friends who will encourage you to be the best you can be,
            come out and see if we are the sisterhood for you.<br><br><br>
            <b>R E C R U I T M E N T</b><br><br>
            Recruitment week allows attendees to familiarize themselves with the
            sisters and fundamental beliefs of our sorority. Recruitment events
            are FREE and there is NO obligation to join, so any interested
            students are welcome to come out to our events. We host a variety of
            events throughout the week (from social to educational) to help
            potential new members determine their perfect fit.<br><br>
            To be eligible for a bid, you must attend at least 1 general
            interest meeting (GIM) and 2 other events.
