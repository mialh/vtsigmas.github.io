                <p style="padding: 0px">The National Philanthropy of Sigma Psi Zeta is to combat violence against women and children in its varied forms. This includes, but is not by any means limited to the following: rape, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, exploitation, the trafficking of women and children, the abuse of migrant workers, intimidation at work, child abuse, harassment, and spousal abuse. Any kind of physical, emotional or mental duress constitutes violence.<br><br>Sisters accomplish this by:</p>

                    <br>Although there are many noteworthy causes and philanthropies, we believe that this is especially an important one. By adopting this ethic within our sorority, we immediately become involved in a demographic that we seek to advocate for - one of the Asian female. Asian women have historically been oppressed by tradition and objectified in the eyes of the contemporary media to be physically powerless, emotionally isolated, and mentally voiceless.<br><br>
                    Some fall prey to violence before they are born, when expectant parents abort their unborn daughters, hoping for sons instead. Sometimes, they are compelled to marry at an early age, or perhaps are raped as a weapon of war. Some are sold or volunteer into economic slavery, to care for households, only to be beaten and/or raped by their masters or incarcerated by local governments. In many countries, and especially on the continent of Asia, women fall victim to traditional practices that violate their human rights. The persistence of the problem has much to do with the fact that most of these physically and psychologically harmful customs are deeply rooted in the tradition and culture of society.<br><br>
                    Violence affects the lives of millions of women worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of women to participate fully in society. Violence against women takes a dismaying variety of forms, and constitutes a violation of basic human rights. It is an obstacle to the achievement of a society's objectives of equality, development and peace. Of course, in this respect, ALL women -- Asian or non-Asian -- when abused, still bleed, cry, and feel the same pain.<br><br>
                    Such a violation of basic human rights is inexcusable. We strive, as women and human beings, to eradicate this form of oppression. We seek redress for the injustices suffered by women of our united cultural backgrounds. Seeing as we will perhaps become the mothers of tomorrow, we might very well have daughters someday that will benefit from such knowledge, and our struggles for this worthy cause.<br><br>
                    We have adopted The New River Valley Women's Center and work closely with the Virginia Tech Women's Center on campus. We also participate in various events on campus and around the community as the opportunity arises. We do not limit our activism soley to our philanthropy but are more than willing to volunteer our time and energy to noteworthy causes.<br><br>
