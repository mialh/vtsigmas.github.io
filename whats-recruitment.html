        <p>
            Sigma Psi Zeta's recruitment process is exclusively designed in order to provide you the opportunity to learn about who we are, what we do, and what we stand for. All of our recruitment events during this process are free and open to all ladies who are interested in our sorority. Our goal during the two weeks of recruitment is simply to help you get know us, and for us to get to know you. Therefore, our recruitment period is non-binding, meaning you will never be required to join if you attend, and we encourage you to venture into all other opportunities offered on our campus during this time.<br><br>
            Please do not hesitate to contact our recruitment chair Esha Islam at <u>enislam@vt.edu</u> with any questions, comments, or concerns you may have. Recruitment is a great time to meet new people, so we hope to see you soon!
