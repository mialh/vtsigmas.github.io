                <p style="padding: 0px">In the Fall semester of 1993, a group of young undergraduate women first came together. These women, hailing from different cultural backgrounds, became close friends. While musing about the state of their campus and their friendships, the idea of forming a sorority casually came up. They believed that a sorority built on their friendships and sharing their vision could address a gap that existed on the SUNY Albany campus. This idea slowly solidified in their minds; these women believed that a sorority built on their friendships, laughter, strengths and dedication would be a formidable force. Over the course of the semester, their group of friends grew closer and in size.<br><br>On February 28, 1994, the Founding Mothers of Sigma Psi Zeta sat down together over dinner to discuss their common goal. They all aimed to establish an organization that encompassed the strength of today's Asian-American woman and her potential for making an impact on the world around her. They came together as friends, realizing the apathy towards Asian women and the dual-disadvantage for being "The Silent Minority."<br><br>On March 23rd, 1994, the State University of New York at Albany formally recognized the sisterhood of Sigma Psi Zeta. This signified the birth of many firsts. Our Alpha Chapter was established on that date, as well as the birth of the first East Coast-based Asian sorority. The founding mothers struggled to establish our organization, our purpose, and most importantly, a precedence by fighting the odds.</p>

                <p style="padding: 0px">In the Spring of 2000, four strong women--San-Young Hwang, Elaine Kwan, An Tran, and Van Tran--joined together on a mission to bring Unity, Sisterhood and Asian Awareness to the Virginia Tech campus. They started off as an interest group called the Multi-Cultural Asian Sorority (MCAS). Through hard work, determination and dedication the women of MCAS became the Kappa Charter of Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority.<br><br>The Kappa Charter was founded on January 7, 2001 and is the first established Multi-Cultural/Asian Interest Sorority recognized at Virginia Tech. We work with other organizations such as the Asian American Student Union, the United Council of Fraternities and Sororities, and the Student Life and Advocacy Office to help bring diversity and cultural awareness to Virginia Tech and the Blacksburg Community.</p>
