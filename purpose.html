        <p style="padding-top: 50px">The fundamental goal of Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority is to promote awareness of the Asian/Asian-American cultures. Our sorority addresses this issue through leadership, outreach, individual, community interaction, and most importantly the bonds of sisterhood. Sigma Psi Zeta also promotes development among its members, the students and the faculty at each of the campuses we represent.<br><br>In order to achieve this goal, we partake in political, social, educational, and cultural activities. Each effort improves our environment, and instills within our sisters experiences that will follow them long after they've graduated. Through a network of like-minded yet highly individualistic women, the sorority lends structure and support to sorors that share this Sigma vision. We believe the strength of our foundation derives from the unity of sisterhood, one that was proudly established over ten years ago.<br><br>In addition, we work in collaboration with other Greek and non-Greek organizations to provide services for the local communities and the community at large. It is through our various participations in these cultural events, educational workshops, and philanthropic support that we are able to make a difference. Nationally, regionally and individually, we strive to embody the ideals of Sigma Psi Zeta.</p>
